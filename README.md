For the Car inventory Project I have to first tranfer the data in Text file into excel format. Then preocess the data further with the use of filtering and cleansing using different codes i.e IFs, VLOOKUP. I then create pivot tables and charts to show a specfic insight to a certain catorgory. For this case it would be the miles of  the car.
