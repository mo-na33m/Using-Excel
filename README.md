For the Bike project I clean the orginal data making sure there is no errors, then i use Pivot tables to create the charts that i will present. 
I use the visual tools in excel to create the charts but i make sure it answeres questions about the data collected. 

For the the employee payroll i showcase how i can create a database for a months employee wages. I use excel commamds to make sure i have accurate data and to 
save time on adding all the numbers up.

For the Gradebook i showcase the use of the condtional formatting in different styles i.e Red for the percenatges and dottated colours in the tests area. 
I then use charts to visaully provide the information. 

For this project I show the filtering and cleansing of the data before using this to produce pivot tabels. I then create the charts to visually showcase what I have found.

For the Carinventory Project I have to first tranfer the Text file into excel then preocess the data further with the use of filtering and cleansing. I then create pivot tables and charts to show a specfic insight to a certian catorgory. For this case it would be the miles in the models of the car.
